The term `soft cost` refers to the hidden business costs that are almost impossible to accurately measure. These costs typically fall into a `metric black hole`.

An example used in the book is about Tom Cochran, who tried to measure how much Atlantic Media were spending for employees to `move data around`, in the form of emails, instead of doing the skilled work they were employed for. He estimated that this was around $1m per year, but despite the data used, it's still inaccurate because it doesn't account for the _value_ created from those emails. 

This is a rough soft cost to the business, and is extremely difficult to identify and measure.

It's important to understand that thre are hidden consequences to seemingly innocent behaviour. Those small distractions have a cost that is very difficult to measure. Eradicating those distractions is imperative to deep work.
