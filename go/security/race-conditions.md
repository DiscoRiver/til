I saw an article on Medium (https://medium.com/trendyol-tech/race-conditions-in-golang-511314c0b85) that suggested using the `atomic` package to fix race conditions for primitive types, which I think is overkill. It perhaps demonstrates a lack of understanding, so I wanted to clarify it here for my own sake.
