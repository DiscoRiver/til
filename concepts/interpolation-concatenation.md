- Interpolation is the process of defining placeholders, which are later replaced with the desired values.
  - Literal definition: _the insertion of something of a different nature into something else._
- Concatenation is combining a series of inputs into a single value.
  - Literal definition: _a series of interconnected things._

Example of interpolation:

```
world = "World"
string = format("Hello {world}", world)
print(string) // Hello World
```

Example of concatenation:

```
string = "Hello" + " " + "World"
print(string) // Hello World
```
