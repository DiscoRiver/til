Pair programming is an agile concept that comes from extreme programming (XP). It is where two engineers work from a single machine on a piece of code.

Typically, this will be in the form of Driver/Navigator. One person will write the code (driver), and the other (navigator) will review the code as it's being generated and offer input and collaboration.
