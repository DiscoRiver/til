# Overview
Extreme programming (XP) is an agile development framework that aims to produce higher software quality, and higher QoL for the development team.

It is the most specific framework regarding practices for software development.

General characteristics where XP is appropriate;

- Dynamically changing software requirements
- Risks caused by fixed-time projects using new technology
- Small, co-located extended development team
- The technology you are using allows for automated unit and functional tests

# Core Values
XP has five core values: communication, simpliciity, feedback, courage, and respect. 

## Communication

XP stresses the importance of face-to-face discussion, with the aid of whiteboards or other drawing mechanism. Ultimately, software development is a team sport.

## Simplicity

Asks the question "what is the simplest thing that will work?" - This is designed to avoid waste and only do what is absolutely necessary, for the requirements that you know about, without trying to predict the future. 

## Feedback 

through feedback on previous efforts, teams can identify areas of improvement, which also supports simple design. Future products are adjusted based on feedback.

## Courage

"Effective action in the face of fear" - This shows a preference for action based on other principles so that results aren't harmful to the team. 

The courage to raise organisational issues. The courage to stop doing something that doesn't work. The courage to accept and act on feedback, even when it's difficult to accept. 

## Respect

Team members need to respect each other in order to communicate, provide and accept feedback, and work together to identify simple designs and solutions. All while not harming your professional relationship.
