- Event: a subset of the sample space. 
    - Probability is assigned to events.
- The probability of any single point within a continuous sample space with infinite precision, is zero. 
    - Think of this like taking an infinite sample space and cutting it in half, then determining the probability of the outcome being in the top half, of bottom half. 

- Probability axioms are the rules by which we use to determine probability. 
    - Nonnegativity (P(A) >= 0): The probability outcome will always be more than zero.
    - Normanization (P(Ω) = 1): The outcome of omega (the sample set) is always 1. This means that we will always get an outcome within the event omega (which we describe), such as the outcome of a dice roll.
    - (Finite) Additivity: 
        - A∩B (A intersection B): This describes the intersecting points of two sets.
        - A∪B (A union B): This describes the union of the two sets, which are the points of A plus B. 
        - (A∩B = Ø) This describes a lack of intersection between A and B.
            - If A∩B = Ø, then P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B)
