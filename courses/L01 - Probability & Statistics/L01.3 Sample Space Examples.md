- There are several ways to model sample sets. 

- Discrete/finite (limited outcomes)
    - This might be some thing like a grid to record numbers from two rolls of a dice.
    - We can also represent this as a tree, which would be called a sequential description.

- Continuous (or infinite)
    - This might be an x/y chart that records co-ordinates of a dart hitting a target, between 0 and 1.
