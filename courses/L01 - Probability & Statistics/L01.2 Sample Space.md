- Probabilistic model = model of a random phenomenon or event
- Describe possible outcomes
- Describe beliefs about likelihood of outcomes
- List (set) of possible outcomes. Called sample space (of possible outcomes).
- Set must be;
    - Mutually exclusive
        - If one outcome is achieved, a different outcome shouldn't also be possible.
    - Collectively exhaustive
        - Elements in set exhaust all possibilities, meaning at the end, one of the outcomes should have occurred.
    - At the "right" granularity.
        - Items in the set should be different in all relevant aspects, but can be similar in irrelevant aspects. 
        - An example used you can have a set for flipping a coin of "heads, tails". This is legitimate set. But you may also have a set like this;
            - Heads (rain)
            - Heads (no rain)
            - Tails (rain)
            - Tails (no rain)
        This is also a legitimate set, but which one should you use? If you believe that rain affects the outcome, then the latter is better for your experiment, and contains the correct level of granularity. Otherwise, it contains irrelevant details (rain), so the first model is better.
        - The correct level of granularity is the set that captures the aspects that are relevant and of interest to you.
