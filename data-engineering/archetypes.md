## Type A data engineers
A stands for abstraction. In this case, the data engineer avoids undifferentiated heavy lifting, keeping data architecture as abstract and straightforward as possible and not reinventing the wheel. Type A data engineers manage the data engineering lifecycle mainly by using entirely off-the-shelf products, managed services, and tools. Type A data engineers work at companies across industries and at all levels of data maturity.

## Type B data engineers
B stands for build. Type B data engineers build data tools and systems that scale and leverage a companyâ€™s core competency and competitive advantage. In the data maturity range, a type B data engineer is more commonly found at companies in stage 2 and 3 (scaling and leading with data), or when an initial data use case is so unique and mission-critical that custom data tools are required to get started.
