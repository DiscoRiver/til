The first thing I struggled to understand is what Kubernetes actually _is_, and why it is needed. I like everyday metaphors to describe complex technology, so here it is;

Imagine you want to open a restaurant. First, you need to provision the kitchen. You hire a construction company (e.g terraform, kubeadm) to construct the building, which has a kitchen, and space for clients to make orders (requests). The building sits on a plot of land (AWS, bare metal, on-premise).

Once your restaurant is open, instead of cooking everything in one big pot, you have many chefs (containers) working on different dishes. But managing them manually is hard. Who starts cooking? Who needs more ingredients? What if a chef quits?

Kubernetes is like a kitchen manager that ensures the kitchen's longevity:
- It assigns dishes (tasks) to chefs.
- It watches over them to make sure they donâ€™t burn out (restarts containers, or replaces them if they fail).
- If a kitchen station malfunctions and cannot be fixed, a new chef is brought in at another station with the same ingredients and recipe to continue cooking.
- It balances the workload so no chef is overwhelmed (load balancing).
- It organizes everything, so orders go to the right chefs. For example, orders for pasta dishes are given to a pasta chef (handles networking).
- If there is a sudden rush of orders, more chefs can be brought in from on-call (or hired) to increase kitchen bandwidth. If orders slow down, some chefs leave, but new chefs can be hired again when demand increases (auto scaling).

Instead of managing containers by hand, Kubernetes automates everything, so apps stay running smoothly, even if computers crash or more users suddenly show up.
