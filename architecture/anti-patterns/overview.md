A software engineering, project management, or business process response to common problems that are usually ineffective and risk being highly counterproductive. 

One simple example is one of the many manual processes that are involved in a daily engineering workflow, maybe doing CLI commits, or running some terraform code. You could build a script to automate some of that, but in the end you might end up with a bloated solution that takes you longer to do your job, or is impossible to maintain due to employee attrition and tribal knowledge. That's an anti-pattern. 

You should look at this wiki if you're interested: https://wiki.c2.com/?AntiPatternsCatalog - I named a few here but I won't extend.

Note: Looking at anti-patterns is a good way to understand what _not_ to do, and identify patterns in your current software.
