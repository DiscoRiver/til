Microservices are individual, decoupled components of a larger architecture.

- Service oriented architecture.
- Encapsulating a functionality that is independently deployable.
- Technology agnostic.
- Each microservice is a black box to other services.
- Communication through network endpoints, such as a queue, or a REST api.
- Embraces information hiding, exposing as little as possible via external interfaces.
- Implantations can be changed freely as long as the interfaces are backward-compatible.
- Changes within a microservice boundary should not affect upstream consumers.
