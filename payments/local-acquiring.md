Local acquiring is a credit card processing method that involves the merchant acquirer (so, the company or financial institution that handles debit and credit card payments on behalf of your business) being based in the country or jurisdiction where the payment is taking place.

Because locally acquired transactions happen in a familiar environment for the issuer – that is, your customer’s bank – there’s less chance of issues popping up. Which, in turn, means that local acquiring tends to be more successful than its counterpart, cross-border acquiring (in which the acquirer is based in a different country to the individual making the purchase).

Even if your business isn’t based in the same country as your customer, local acquiring means you can process payments as if it was – and allows you to take advantage of the many cost-saving, authorization rate-boosting, and compliance-ensuring benefits that offers.
